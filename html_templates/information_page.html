      <h2>Welcome to the CSCAR treatment assignment system</h2>
      <p><b>Background:</b> The sequential treatment assignment
      system is intended to assist researchers who are conducting
      trials in which subjects are assigned sequentially to treatment
      groups.  It aims to provide treatment assignments that are
      balanced across the levels of one or more pre-treatment
      covariates.  Sequential assignment is useful whenever a complete
      list of all research subjects is not available at the beginning
      of a trial.  It is especially effective when a study will enroll
      a small or moderate number of subjects.
      <p><b>Methodology:</b> This system implements an approach to
      treatment assignment using minimization that was described in
      Pocock and Simon (<em>Biometrics</em> 31, 1975).  The
      minimization approach reduces covariate imbalances by utilizing
      non-uniform assignment probabilities for the different treatment
      groups, in order to reduce the level of imbalance following each
      round of treatment assignment.  Although the probabilities are
      not uniform, the treatment assignments are still random, which
      reduces the risk that a user can bias the results of the trial
      by selectively enrolling patients.
      <p><b>Security:</b> This system identifies users through their
      Google account id.  Users must be signed into their Google
      account whenever using the system. This system runs on Google
      AppEngine and the data are stored on Google's servers.  You will
      be given the option to store either complete data or aggregated
      data for the subjects in your study.  In the latter case, only
      the frequency distributions of each covariate within each
      treatment group are retained by the system.
